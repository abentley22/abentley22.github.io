            <p>The screwdriver project was another part of <i>MECH200</i>. It was assigned after the completion of the clock. It used many different machining processes that were not included in the clock project!</p>

              <h3>Process Summary</h3>
              <p>The screwdriver was a super fun part to make. We were given the base as shown in the figure below. The manufacturing processes utilized in this part included:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><p>In the manual lathe, we finished off the base and drilled a small pilot hole, and then inserted it into the knurling attachment in the lathe. Knurling was how the diamond patter on the handle was acheived. </p></li>
                  <li><p>Then we had to forge the head by heating it up and using a drop force to shape it further into the screwdriver shape. We then oil quenched it for heat treatment. </p></li>
                <li><p>The last step was to spend hours grinding away the unnecessary metal so it could look pretty.</p></li>
                </ol>

              <h3> Finally...</h3>
              <p>This part was super fun to make. The forging process was difficult because I had to make sure it was hot enough to put into the drop forge, and then still hot enough to heat treat.</p>
                <p>I also really enjoyed getting to grind all the metal away and then sand it to make it look exactly how I wanted it to. Currently it is sitting in my dad's tools, and I have heard that he uses it from time to time.</p>
