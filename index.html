      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is Alaina Bentley and I was born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska. Currently, I am living in Fort
        Collins, Colorado as a recent graduate at Colorado State University. I have just completed my Bachelor of Science in
        Mechanical Engineering, including an Aerospace Concentration and a Mathematics Minor.
      </p>
      <p>During my time at CSU, I completed 138 credits and maintained a 3.33 GPA. I worked two on-campus jobs during
        the school year, one as an Intramural Manager and another as a TA for the Math department. Currently, I am awaiting the start of my Early Career position as a Mechanical Propulsion Engineer at Lockheed Martin Space</p>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy hiking, skiing, camping, video games, and extending my knowledge. As of right now, I am
        learning a few different coding languages and spending time with my dog and friends.</p>
      <p>As a Mechanical Engineering graduate, there were many projects and reports completed during my undergrad.
        This website will highlight my most prominent projects.</p>
